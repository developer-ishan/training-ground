## How to Build a Simple Database: Bash CLI vs Java (Indexed & Non-Indexed)

### 1. Creating a Simple Database Using Bash CLI

You can build a basic key-value store using a shell script and a text file. Here’s a minimal example:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh

db_set(){
    echo "$1,$2" >> database
}

db_get(){
    grep "^$1," database | sed -e "s/^$1,//" | tail -n 1
}
```

- `db_set key value` appends a new line to the `database` file.
- `db_get key` retrieves the latest value for a key.

This approach is great for quick prototyping and small datasets.

### 2. Creating a Simple Database in Java

A similar approach in Java uses file I/O to store and retrieve key-value pairs:

```java
public class SimpleDB {
    private final File dbFile;

    public SimpleDB(String filename) {
        this.dbFile = new File(filename);
    }

    public void set(String key, String value) throws IOException {
        try (FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(dbFile, true)) {
            fw.write(key + "," + value + "\n");
        }
    }

    public String get(String key) throws IOException {
        String result = null;
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(dbFile))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                if (line.startsWith(key + ",")) {
                    result = line.substring((key + ",").length());
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

This Java class mimics the Bash script, storing each entry as a line in a text file.

### 3. Creating a Simple Indexed Database in Java

For faster reads, you can maintain an index file that maps keys to their byte offsets in the database file:

```java
public class IndexedSimpleDB {
    private final File dbFile;
    private final File indexFile;
    private final Map<String, Long> indexMap = new HashMap<>();

    public IndexedSimpleDB(String dbFilename, String indexFilename) throws IOException {
        this.dbFile = new File(dbFilename);
        this.indexFile = new File(indexFilename);
        loadIndex();
    }

    private void loadIndex() throws IOException {
        // ...load index from file...
    }

    public void set(String key, String value) throws IOException {
        // ...append to dbFile, update indexMap, save index...
    }

    public String get(String key) throws IOException {
        // ...seek to offset in dbFile, read value...
    }
}
```

The index file stores lines like `key,offset`, allowing direct access to values without scanning the whole file.

### 4. Comparing Performance

To compare performance, run a load test that writes and reads thousands of records:

- **SimpleDB**: Fast writes, slow reads (linear scan).
- **IndexedSimpleDB**: Slower writes (due to index maintenance), much faster reads (direct access).

Example results for 10,000 records (~1MB file):

```
SimpleDB write time: 437 ms
SimpleDB read time: 4583 ms
IndexedSimpleDB write time: 4475 ms
IndexedSimpleDB read time: 275 ms
```

### 5. Comments on Performance (Read vs Write Trade-off)

- **SimpleDB** is efficient for appending data, but read operations become slower as the file grows.
- **IndexedSimpleDB** sacrifices write speed for much faster reads, ideal for scenarios where read performance is critical.
- The trade-off: maintaining an index adds overhead to writes, but enables near-instant lookups.

**Conclusion:**  
For small datasets or write-heavy workloads, a simple text-based approach may suffice. For larger datasets or read-heavy workloads, indexing is essential for scalable performance.

## Further optimizations

Here are ways to further optimize your `IndexedSimpleDB` for better performance, especially for large files and frequent writes:

- Batch Index Updates:
    Instead of saving the index file after every write, batch updates and write the index file only once after many inserts, or at shutdown.

- Use BufferedWriter for Database Writes:
    Writing with a `BufferedWriter` instead of `RandomAccessFile.writeBytes` can reduce disk I/O overhead.

- Keep Index in Memory:
    You already do this, but ensure the index map is only written to disk when necessary (not after every insert).

- Use Memory-Mapped Files:
    For very large files, consider using Java’s `MappedByteBuffer` for faster random access.

- Optimize Index File Format:
    Use a binary format for the index file (e.g., `DataOutputStream`) for faster read/write and smaller file size.

- Concurrent Access:
    If you need multi-threaded access, use concurrent data structures and synchronize file writes.

- Avoid Duplicate Key Checks on Disk:
    Your current implementation checks the in-memory index, which is fast. If you ever need to support updates, consider a more advanced structure (like a B-tree or log-structured merge tree).

- Preallocate File Space:
    For very frequent writes, preallocate space in the database file to avoid fragmentation.

- Profile and Tune JVM:
    Use JVM profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and tune garbage collection or memory settings.
