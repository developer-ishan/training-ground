# LLD Question: Mediator Design Pattern

Design a chat room application using the Mediator design pattern.

**Requirements:**

- Multiple users can join the chat room.
- Users send messages to the chat room mediator.
- The mediator handles the message routing and delivers it to the intended recipients.
- Users do not communicate directly with each other but only through the mediator.
- Support private messages (user-to-user) and broadcast messages (to all users).
- Users can join and leave the chat room dynamically.

**Tasks:**

1. Design the classes and interfaces needed to implement the Mediator pattern for the chat room.
2. Show how the mediator manages communication between users.
3. Discuss the benefits of using the Mediator pattern in this context.
4. Extend the design to allow message filtering or moderation by the mediator before delivery.

Provide UML class diagrams and code snippets where appropriate.
