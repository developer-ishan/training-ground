Great question! While the **Mediator** pattern is the core of the solution for a chat room system where objects (users) communicate indirectly via a central object (mediator), several **other design patterns** can complement and enhance this implementation depending on the complexity and feature set.

Here’s a breakdown of applicable design patterns:

---

### ✅ **1. Mediator Pattern** (Primary)

* **Purpose**: Centralizes complex communications between objects (users).
* **Usage**: The `ChatRoom` acts as a mediator to manage message routing between `User` objects.

---

### ✅ **2. Observer Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Notifies subscribed users when something changes.
* **Usage**: For broadcast messages — all registered users (observers) get notified when a message is sent.
* **Example**: Each user subscribes to the chat room updates and receives new messages.

---

### ✅ **3. Command Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing undo/redo or logging of commands.
* **Usage**: Encapsulate a `SendMessageCommand` or `LeaveRoomCommand` — useful for implementing features like:

    * Logging message history
    * Undo/redo message actions
    * Queued/batched messaging

---

### ✅ **4. Strategy Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Allows dynamic selection of communication behavior.
* **Usage**: Different strategies for:

    * Message delivery (reliable vs best-effort)
    * Message formatting
    * Notification type (e.g., popup, silent)

---

### ✅ **5. Factory Method / Abstract Factory Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Creates user or message objects based on roles or message types.
* **Usage**:

    * Create different kinds of `User` objects: Admin, Guest, Premium.
    * Create `Message` objects: TextMessage, ImageMessage, PrivateMessage.

---

### ✅ **6. Decorator Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
* **Usage**: Add features like:

    * Emoji rendering
    * Markdown support
    * Timestamp annotations to messages

---

### ✅ **7. Singleton Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Ensure a single instance of a class.
* **Usage**: The `ChatRoomMediator` can be implemented as a Singleton if the application only supports one global chat room.

---

### ✅ **8. Proxy Pattern**

* **Purpose**: Control access to an object.
* **Usage**:

    * Message filtering/moderation
    * Logging
    * Rate limiting user actions

### Summary of Pattern Applications:

| **Feature**               | **Design Pattern** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Core message routing      | Mediator           |
| Real-time updates         | Observer           |
| Command history / Undo    | Command            |
| Switchable delivery modes | Strategy           |
| Message/user creation     | Factory            |
| Add features to messages  | Decorator          |
| Global chatroom           | Singleton          |
| Filter/moderate messages  | Proxy              |
