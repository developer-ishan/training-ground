### ðŸ’¡ **LLD Question: Visitor Design Pattern**

You are designing a **Tax Calculation System** for different types of items in a shopping application. Each item (like electronics, groceries, and clothing) has a different tax policy.

You are asked to:

* Design a system where **new types of operations** (like tax calculation, discount application, shipping estimation) can be added **without modifying existing item classes**.
* Ensure that each item type can have **different logic per operation** (e.g., electronics may have 18% tax, groceries 5%).

#### Requirements:

1. There are three types of items:

    * `ElectronicsItem`
    * `GroceryItem`
    * `ClothingItem`

2. Each item should accept a `Visitor` that defines the operation to be performed.

3. Create a `TaxCalculatorVisitor` that calculates and prints tax for each item.

4. Use the **Visitor design pattern** to solve this.
